=======================================================
============ Changes from 0.7.2 to current ============
=======================================================


   0.9.9: Addition of beta functions for controlling flow control lines for
   DOS and linux, shells only for unix and ming

   0.9.9: Signals now cause clean closedown under DOS

   0.9.9: Documentation corrections (Thanks to Christopher Sandberg)

   0.9.9: Stub (ie non functioning but non failing) ming version added

   0.9.9: exterm.c uses Allegro properly under linux now!

   0.9.9: Linux version does not fail before allowing reconfigure if the
   default (com) port is not physically present now.

   0.9.8: Djgpp makefile extended to allow user to specify the allegro
   library name.

   0.9.8: fifo code cleaned up a bit.

   0.9.8: djirqs.s ljmp brought into line with more recent (stricter) gcc
   assembler syntax.

   0.9.8: First go at removing dependance on allegro.

   0.9.7: Initial go at a generic unix driver. Does not handle setting of IRQs
   and io addresses.

   0.9.7: Corrected an RTS/CTS flow error, thanks SET.

   0.9.7: Added in a couple of slowing reads to the DOS FIFO initialisation
   code so that less perfect motherboards don't hang.

   0.9.6: Failure to load config files now trapped and exitted on in exterm.

   0.9.6: Added a makefile for a unix to DOS cross compiler.

   0.9.6: Corrected a flow error in the 0.9.5 DOS interrupt handler that
   hung the machine.

   0.9.5: Added comm_port_{in,out}_full calls. Changed the indirect function
   to achieve this.

   0.9.5: Kicking of UARTs that do not handle THRE properly put in correctly,
   hopefully. thanks to Peter Worsfield and Mike for pointing out the
   omission.

   0.9.5: Error in final return statement in comm_port_out_empty corrected.

   0.9.4: becomes its own library to ease multi-platform installation 

   0.9.4: No longer necessary to call comm_port_delete on exit as dzcomm
   installs it's own atexit routine (dzcomm_closedown) which will clear up
   whatever needs clearing up. comm_port_delete still available and
   dzcomm_closedown can be called prior to program exit if resources need
   releasing.

   0.9.4: All of the output functions now return an integer.

   0.9.4: linux generally works excepting: direct RTS control (which is
   a hack in DOS only currently) and MCR/LSR callback routines.

   0.9.4: now a separate file tree from allegro to keep things clear 
   and simple.

   0.9.4: test program (rs232) added. It either tests between two ports on
   the same machine or between two machines running it.

   0.9.4: documentation now done using the allegro system, man (unix) and
   info pages generated automatically and installed if so required.

   0.9.4: All the enums made to be standard 0-(N-1) enums. Different low
   level drivers then interrpret them as appropriate.

   0.9.3: Minor bugs cleared up, thanks to Tim Collins.

   0.9.3: Tim Collins makes the RTS/CTS handshaking work.

   0.9.2: comm_port_{in,out}_empty added, they idnicate whether then in/out 
   buffers currently have anything in them.

   0.9.2: PARITY enum and code changed to extend and imrpove parity handling.

   0.9.1: Changed to three files to fit in with Allegro 4.0 sturcture

   0.9.1: Makefile changed to take advantage of new allegro makefile

   0.9.1: Unlimited number of ports added

   0.9.1: removed the cport macro

   0.9.1: comN vaiables removed

   0.9.1: IRQ sharing seems to work

   0.9.1: comm_port_send_break() added

   0.9.1: access functions for the comm_port structure added so the the API
   is not dependant on users altering the comm_port structure directly

   0.9.1: examples files moved to allegro/examples

   0.9.1: exqueue added to demonstrate queue functionality

   0.9.1: .ini files only define one port but no longer require the [] syntax
   at the beginning and end



==============================================================
============ Changes from 0.6 to 0.7.x (Mar 1999) ============
==============================================================

   The need to alter allegro source was removed. The source tree then 
   split into the 0.7.x branch, bug changes only for the DJGPP allegro
   only version.



============================================================
============ Changes from 0.5 to 0.6 (Sep 1998) ============
============================================================

   Initial version of IRQ sharing software added. Obviously this requires 
   the hardware to be capable of generating shared IRQs. 
   
   comm_port_delete() and comm_port_reinstall() cleaned up.
