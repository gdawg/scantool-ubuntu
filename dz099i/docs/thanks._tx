Thanks!

   Many thanks to everyone who's helped in the ongoing development of
   dzcomm. 
   
   First, a big thank you to all the people who help me test and debug this 
   code. It sometimes gets frustrating to receive messages saying "it 
   doesn't work!", but they are useful all the same...

   DJ Delorie (<email>dj@delorie.com</a>),
   Eli Zaretskii (<email>eliz@is.elta.co.il</a>),
   and everyone else who has contributed to djgpp.

   Shawn Hargreaves (<email>shawn@talula.demon.co.uk</a>)
   and everyone else who has contributed to Allegro.
