The Dzcomm Hacker's Guide

<br><hr>
<br><i>
This is a guide to some of the internal workings of dzcomm, for people who 
are interested in hacking on it. This document is far from complete, and may 
not always be 100% accurate. Remember that when in doubt, the sources are 
always the definitive reference. Suggestions for what to include in this 
document will be very welcome: there is far too much code for me to go over 
it all in any kind of detail, so I want to concentrate on the things that 
people find most confusing...
<p>
This guide is the goal towards which we are moving. Eventually the code will
all be compliant with these ideas and all the references to 'allegro' will
have been corrected as appropriate.
<p>
Dzcomm has been inspired by two things: First, the original version written
by Dim to take advantage of the DJGPP compiler. Second, Allegro. Allegro has
inspired me to see if I can make this thing a multi-platform API. You will
notice a huge similarity between the way dzcomm is set up and Allegro. In
this case imitation is a sincere form of recognition of something excellent.
<p>
Consequently you wil find that this document is very similar to the one that
comes with Allegro.

[As per Allegro]
<p>
I'm not going to be a fascist about this, but it does make life easier if 
all the code uses a consistent layout. If you are going to write and 
maintain more than one complete source file of your own, I think you are 
entitled to do that however you like, but for smaller contributions, I will 
probably reformat your code to fit in with my existing style. It will 
obviously save me time if you write it this way in the first place, hence 
this description:
<p>
Basic Allegro style: K&R, with 3 space indentation. On disk, though, tab 
stops are 8 spaces, so if for example a line was indented by 12 spaces, this 
would be saved out as either 12 space characters or 1 tab and 4 spaces, not 
as 4 tabs. If your editor can't handle the difference between 3 char 
internal and 8 char external tab stops, either get a better editor or use 
indent to clean up after yourself. The indent.pro file included with the 
Allegro distribution comes close to getting this layout right, but doesn't 
quite manage it, so some things still need to be cleaned up by hand.
<p>
Preprocessor defines and structure names are UPPER_CASE. Function and 
variable names are lower_case. MixedCaseNames are evil and should not be 
used. That silly m_pHungarian notation is _really_ evil and should not even 
be thought about.
<p>
All symbols should be declared as static unless that is absolutely not 
possible, in which case they should be prefixed with an underscore.
<p>
Functions look like this:
<p><pre>
/* foobar:
 *  Description of what it does.
 */
void foobar(int foo, int bar)
{
   /* do some stuff */
}
<p></pre>
Three blank lines between functions.
<p>
Conditionals look like:
<p><pre>
   if (foo) {
      /* stuff */
   }
   else {
      /* stuff */
   }
<p></pre>
The only time when something comes on the same line after a closing brace is 
at the end of a do/while loop, eg:
<p><pre>
   do {
      /* stuff */
   } while (foo);
<p></pre>
Case statements look like this:
<p><pre>
   switch (foo) {
<p>
      case bar:
         /* stuff */
         break;
<p>
      default:
         /* stuff */
         break;
   }
<p></pre>
Examples of where to put spaces:
<p><pre>
   char *p;
   if (condition) { }
   for (x=0; x&lt;10; x++) { }
   function(foo, bar);
   (BITMAP *)data[id].dat;
<p></pre>
All sources should begin with the standard header:
<p><pre>
/*
 * DZcomm : a serial port API.
 * file : XXXXXX.c
 *
 * Brief description of what this file does
 * 
 * Brief credits
 *
 * See readme.txt for copyright information.
 */
<p></pre>
Author credits should be added in chronological order, and email addresses 
should not be included: those can be found in the main credits file, and if 
they only exist in one place, it is easier to update them when people change 
address.
<p>
People only need to be listed in the source file header if they've made a 
significant contribution to it (one-line fixes don't count), but no matter 
how small their addition, they must be added to the docs/thanks._tx file. 
This is sorted alphabetically by name. If they are already in it, update the 
text to describe the new addition, otherwise make a new entry for the new 
contributor. Also, anything more than very tiny modifications should be 
added to the docs/changes._tx file, which grows from the top in reverse 
chronological order. This file should briefly describe both the nature of 
the modification and who did it.

This is very different depending on whether you are using autoconf or a 
fixed makefile. For most platforms, though, the fixup script (eg. 
fixdjgpp.bat), will create a small makefile, which defines MAKEFILE_INC to 
the make of another file (eg. makefile.dj), and then includes makefile.all. 
This contains a lot of generic rules, and includes the file named in 
MAKEFILE_INC to provide additional platform-specific information. The actual 
source files are listed in makefile.lst.
<p>
There are three library targets: alleg (release), alld (debugging), and allp 
(profiling). Objects go in obj/compiler/version/, where version is one of 
alleg, alld, or allp. Libraries go in lib/compiler/. A few generated things 
(asmdefs.inc, mmxtest.s, etc), go in the root of obj/compiler/. Dependencies 
are generated by "make depend", and go in obj/compiler/version/makefile.dep, 
which is included by makefile.all.
<p>
When you run "make clean", this only deletes harmless generated files like 
the objects. "make distclean" strips you right back to the original 
distribution, including getting rid of the test executables and the library 
itself. For the ultimate in personal hygene, run "make veryclean", which 
will wipe absolutely all generated files. After doing this, you will have to 
run "make depend" before you can build the library, and also "fixdll.bat" if 
you are working on a Windows platform.
<p>
To pass long commandlines to the MSVC and Watcom linkers, the program 
runner.exe is compiled using gcc, so make can pass it a decent number of 
arguments. This just saves the parameters into a temporary file, and then 
invokes the real command using that as an argument file.
<p>
All the makefiles currently use gcc for dependency generation, because this 
is easier than trying to get MSVC or Watcom to output the right info.
<p>
The symbol LIBRARY_VERSION, defined at the top of the makefile.all, is used 
for including a version number in things like the DLL filename.
<p>

<h1><a name="Header Files">Header Files</a></h1>
<p>
dzcomm.h lives in the include/ directory. This includes other headers which 
live in include/dzcomm/. The reason for this slightly odd approach is that 
allegro.h can include things like "allegro/alconfig.h", which will work both 
in-situ within the build directory, and if we copy allegro.h to the system 
include directory and the other headers into system_include/allegro/. This 
avoids cluttering the system directories with lots of our headers, while 
still allowing programs to just include &lt;allegro.h&gt;, and also makes it 
possible for people to access internal headers with #include 
&lt;allegro/aintern.h&gt;.
<p>
dzcomm.h contains structure definitions and function prototypes. At the end 
of the file, it includes alinline.h, which defines all the inline routines 
and vtable wrappers, along with C versions of the fixed point math routines 
if no inline asm is available. If inline asm is supported, it includes one 
of al386gcc.h, al386vc.h, or al386wat.h.
<p>
dzintern.h defines routines that are shared between multiple sources, but
that we don't generally want user programs to see. For platform-specific
internal definitions, we will use dzintdos.h, dzintwin.h, etc. if necessary.
These headers are not included directly by dzcomm.h, but can still be
included by the more brave or foolish type of user program :-)
<p>
<br>
<br>
<h1><a name="Definitions">Definitions</a></h1>
<p>
All header function prototypes should use the macro AL_FUNC(). Inline 
routines use the macro AL_INLINE(). Global variables use AL_VAR() or 
AL_ARRAY(). Global pointers to functions use AL_FUNCPTR(). Pointers to 
functions which are passed as parameters to other routines or stored in a 
structure typedef use AL_METHOD(). This may seem like something of an 
overkill, but it gives us a lot of flexibility to add DLL import/export 
specifiers, calling convention markers like __cdecl, and even to mangle 
symbol names on some compilers. If you forget to use these macros, your code 
won't work on some platforms.
<p>
This only applies to header files, though: you can write normal code in the 
C sources.
<p>
The symbol ALLEGRO_SRC is defined while compiling library source files. If 
you want to inline a function in one of your sources, use the INLINE macro. 
To declare a zero-sized array in a structure, use int x[ZERO_SIZE]. To use 
64 bit integers, declare a LONG_LONG variable (this won't be defined on all 
platforms). To do things with filenames, check the macros ALLEGRO_LFN, 
OTHER_PATH_SEPARATOR, and DEVICE_SEPARATOR. See the headers for details.
<p>
<br>

<p>
Currently there is no asm code in dzcomm. If we do start using it we will use
something on the same lines as Allegro.
<p>
<br>

<p>
Any portable routines that run inside a timer handler or input callback must 
be sure to lock all the code and data that they touch. This is done by 
placing an END_OF_FUNCTION(x) or END_OF_STATIC_FUNCTION(x) after each 
function definition (this is not required if you declare the function as 
INLINE, though), and then calling LOCK_FUNCTION() somewhere in your init 
code. Use LOCK_VARIABLE() to lock global variables, and LOCK_DATA() to lock 
allocated memory.
<p>
Any modules that have cleanup code should register their exit function by 
calling _add_exit_func(). This will ensure that they are closed down 
gracefully no matter whether the user calls allegro_exit(), falls off the 
bottom of main(), or the program dies suddenly due to a runtime error. You 
must call _remove_exit_func() from inside your shutdown routine, or you will 
find yourself stuck in an endless loop.
