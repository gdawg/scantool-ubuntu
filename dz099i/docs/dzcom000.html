See readme.txt for a general introduction, copyright details, and 
information about how to install dzcomm and link your program with it.
<p>
Dzcomm is a result of the magnificent Allegro library. It has provided the
inspiration and in many cases the code which has simplfied the process of
developping what I hope will become a multi-platform serial line API.
<p>
Hopefully, Dzcomm has now evolved to the point where it can work alongside
allegro but no longer relies on it. It should have alternative routines
for everything it previosuly relied on allegro to do and should decide
when you compile it in whether to use allegros routines or its own.
<p>
To use dzcomm in your code you will need to put
<p><pre>
      #include &lt;dzcomm.h&gt;
<p></pre>
in your code. Obviously (I hope) this will only work after you've installed
the library. If you wish to use allegro alongside dzcomm you will need to
include the allegro library. If you do so it is IMPERATIVE that you include
allegro first (this how dzcomm knows where to link to):
<p><pre>
      #include &lt;allegro.h&gt;
      #include &lt;dzcomm.h&gt;
<p></pre>
<br>
If you have more than one C file in a project and you wish to access dzcomm
from more than one of those files, you must put the following #define before
all but one of the dzcomm includes:
<p><pre>
      #define DZCOMM_SECONDARY_INCLUDE
      #include &lt;dzcomm.h&gt;
<p></pre>
However, do remember to inlcude it once without the #define!
