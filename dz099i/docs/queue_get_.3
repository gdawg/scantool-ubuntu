.SH NAME
queue_get_
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <dzcomm.h>

.B int queue_get_(fifo_queue *q,void *data);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Get value from queue. Returns the value from the top of the queue
(in the memory location pointed to by data). The returned integer
is DZQ_NEARLY_FULL if the queue\'s getting a tad full,
DZQ_NOT_NEARLY_FULL otherwise. On failure returns
DZQ_FAIL_NO_Q if q was a NULL pointer or DZQ_FAIL_EMPTY
if the queue was actually empty. Note that failure codes
are less than zero, success codes greater than or equal
to zero. Use queue_empty before calling queue_get to verify that
there is data to get.
