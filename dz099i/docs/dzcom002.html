Having set up your ports you will want to use them! To do this you must
install the handler. Having donw this ou can then read from and write
to the ports.
<p>
<b>int <a name="comm_port_install_handler">comm_port_install_handler</a>(comm_port *port);</b><br>
   Once the port has been configured, whether from a file or by using the
   comm_port_set_* routines, this function must be called to ensure that
   the port is running with the desired confiuration. It should only be
   called once per port, configuration changes should be enfored using
   comm_port_reinstall. Until this function is called the port cannot be
   written to or read from.
<p>
<b>int <a name="comm_port_reinsatall">comm_port_reinsatall</a>(comm_port *port);</b><br>
   If there is a need to reconfigure the port after comm_port_install_port
   has been called, this can be achieved in two steps. First, reconfigure
   the comm_port structure either using a file or using the comm_port_set_*
   functions. Then call this function to ensure that they take effect. This
   call will wait for any remaining data on the transmit queue to clear
   before reconfiguring the port.
<p>
<b>void <a name="comm_port_uninstall">comm_port_uninstall</a>(comm_port *port);</b><br>
   Removes the port from the list of functioning ports under dzcomm. Once
   this function has been called it is no longer to write to or read from
   the port. Use comm_port_install_handler to get the port running again.
   This function will wait for any remaining data on the transmit queue to
   clear before uninstalling the port.
<p>   
<b>void <a name="comm_port_flush_output">comm_port_flush_output</a>(comm_port *port);</b><br>
   Flushes the input buffer.
<p>
<b>void <a name="comm_port_flush_input">comm_port_flush_input</a>(comm_port *port);</b><br>
   Flushes the input buffer.
<p>
<b>void <a name="comm_port_delete">comm_port_delete</a>(comm_port *port);</b><br>
   Having uninstalled your port you may decide that you don't need the
   configuration data either and can better use the memory elsewhere.
   Calling this function will free up the memory used to store and run
   the port. However, please don't try to install the port after you've
   called comm_port_delete.
<p>
<b>int <a name="comm_port_out">comm_port_out</a>(comm_port *port, unsigned char c);</b><br>
   Puts 'c' on the software output buffer. The UART will then output the
   contents of this buffer. c must not use more than the number of bits
   specified configured for data. Returns 1 if the character is successfuly
   placed on the buffer, 0 otherwise.
<p>
<b>int <a name="comm_port_out_empty">comm_port_out_empty</a>(comm_port *port);</b><br>
   Indicates if there is data waiting to be sent to the UART. Returns 0
   if there is data waiting to be sent, -1 if the buffer is empty. Also
   returns 0 on failure.
<p>
<b>int <a name="comm_port_out_full">comm_port_out_full</a>(comm_port *port);</b><br>
   Indicates if the buffer of data waiting to be sent is now full. Returns -1
   if this is the case and 0 if there is still room for more data on the
   buffer. Also returns 0 on failure.
<p>
<b>int <a name="comm_port_string_send">comm_port_string_send</a>(comm_port *port,char *s);</b><br>
   The string 's' is sent to the output buffer one character at a time; the
   UART will transmit this down the serial line. Returns the number of characters
   successfully placed on the output buffer.
<p>
<b>int <a name="comm_port_command_send">comm_port_command_send</a>(comm_port *port,char *s);</b><br>
   The string 's' is sent to the output buffer one character at a time; the
   UART will transmit this down the serial line. At the end of the string a
   '\r' character is sent. Returns the number of characters successfully placed
   on the output buffer, counting the '\r'. A successfuly send will therefore
   return the length of the string given to it plus one.
<p>
<b>int <a name="comm_port_in_empty">comm_port_in_empty</a>(comm_port *port);</b><br>
   Indicates if data has come in on the serial line. It returns -1 if there is
   no data (ie. the buffer is empty), 0 if there is data waiting to be read.
   Also returns 0 on failure.
<p>
<b>int <a name="comm_port_in_full">comm_port_in_full</a>(comm_port *port);</b><br>
   Indicates if the buffer of data which has come in on the serial line is now
   full. It retunr -1 if this is the case (ie. the buffer is full) and 0
   otherwise. Also return 0 on failure.
<p>
<b>inline int <a name="comm_port_test">comm_port_test</a>(comm_port *port);</b><br>
   Checks to see data has come in on the data line. If there is none it returns
   -1, like comm_port_in_empty. If there is some it returns the next character
   from the queue of those received from the serial line (and takes it off the
   queue).
<p>
<b>void <a name="comm_port_send_break">comm_port_send_break</a>(comm_port *port, int msec_duration);</b><br>
   A break signal is issued on the serial line. The break signal will be at
   least of the duration specified. It may be longer.
<p>
<b>int <a name="comm_port_give_line_status">comm_port_give_line_status</a>(comm_port *port, dzcomm_line line);</b><br>
   Returns the value (1 or 0) of the register requested or -1 on failure. Note
   that the value returned is the inverse of the physical state of the line
   connected to the UART because the control lines on a UART are all low
   when the register is high and vice versa.
<p>
   The control line is defined using the following enum:
<p><pre>
      typedef enum {DZCOMM_DTR, DZCOMM_RTS, DZCOMM_CTS, DZCOMM_DSR} dzcomm_line;
<p></pre>
<br>
<b>int <a name="comm_port_set_line_status">comm_port_set_line_status</a>(comm_port *port, dzcomm_line line, int value);</b><br>
   Sets the value of the register requested and return 1 on success or -1 on
   failure. Note that the physical state of the line connected to the UART
   will be the inverse of the value set here because the control lines on
   a UART are all low when the register is high and vice versa.
<p>
   The control line is defined using the following enum:
<p><pre>
      typedef enum {DZCOMM_DTR, DZCOMM_RTS, DZCOMM_CTS, DZCOMM_DSR} dzcomm_line;
<p></pre>
<br>
   Be careful when using this function - if you are using CTS_RTS flow
   control or if the UART at the other end is snesitive to it, you may
   cause confusion ...
<p>
<b>int <a name="modem_hangup">modem_hangup</a>(comm_port *port);</b><br>
   Sends "+++ATH0" to the line which tells it to hang up if it's a modem. Returns
   one if the entire string (including the concluding '\r') is placed on the output
   buffer, zero otherwise.
