.SH NAME
comm_port_set_line_status
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <dzcomm.h>

.B int comm_port_set_line_status(comm_port *port, dzcomm_line line, int value);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Sets the value of the register requested and return 1 on success or -1 on
failure. Note that the physical state of the line connected to the UART
will be the inverse of the value set here because the control lines on
a UART are all low when the register is high and vice versa.

The control line is defined using the following enum:

.nf
   typedef enum {DZCOMM_DTR, DZCOMM_RTS, DZCOMM_CTS, DZCOMM_DSR} dzcomm_line;
   
.fi

Be careful when using this function - if you are using CTS_RTS flow
control or if the UART at the other end is snesitive to it, you may
cause confusion ...
