comm_port_reinsatall
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <dzcomm.h>

.B int comm_port_reinsatall(comm_port *port);
.SH DESCRIPTION
If there is a need to reconfigure the port after comm_port_install_port
has been called, this can be achieved in two steps. First, reconfigure
the comm_port structure either using a file or using the comm_port_set_*
functions. Then call this function to ensure that they take effect. This
call will wait for any remaining data on the transmit queue to clear
before reconfiguring the port.
