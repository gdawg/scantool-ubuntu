.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <dzcomm.h>

.B void comm_port_set_msr_handler(comm_port *port, int (*msr_handler)(comm_port *port, int msr_contents));
.SH DESCRIPTION
HANDLE WITH CARE. This sets a routine which will be called when the
UART returns an MSR condition. The code mnust be locked in memory if
your system requires it. the msr_handler argument is the function
which will be called when the condition arises:

.nf
   int msr_hander(comm_port *port, int msr_contents)
   
.fi
It take two arguments: the port on which the condition arose and the
contents of the MSR register. You should not reread the MSR in the
handler as the read which was used to pass the contents to this
function will have reset it.

dz_ll_handler is simply a shorthand for a pointer to the above type of
function.
