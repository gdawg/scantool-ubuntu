.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <dzcomm.h>

.B void comm_port_delete(comm_port *port);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Having uninstalled your port you may decide that you don\'t need the
configuration data either and can better use the memory elsewhere.
Calling this function will free up the memory used to store and run
the port. However, please don\'t try to install the port after you\'ve
called comm_port_delete.
