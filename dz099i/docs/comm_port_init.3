.SH NAME
comm_port_init
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <dzcomm.h>

.B comm_port *comm_port_init(comm n);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Creates a handle (which is a pointer to a structre) for a new port.
The argument, defined below, simply gives comm_port_init a hint as
to which potentially built-in port the port should define. If the
port you are using bears no relation to a standard PC built in port
just send an arbitrary argument and then use the comm_port_set_*
routines to describe the port. Even if if you are using a standard
port you will want to use the comm_port_set_* routines to complete
the configuration of the port.

The argument must be one of the following. Please use these values
rather than infering what the enum values might be.

.nf
   typedef enum {_com1, _com2, _com3, _com4, _com5, _com6, _com7, _com8} comm;
   
.fi
