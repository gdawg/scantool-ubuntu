.SH NAME
queue_peek_
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <dzcomm.h>

.B int queue_peek_(fifo_queue *q,void *data);
.SH DESCRIPTION
See the value at the top of the queue. Returns (in the memory
location pointed to by data) the value from the top of the queue
but does not remove it from the queue. The returned integer is
DZQ_NEARLY_FULL if the queue\'s getting a tad full,
DZQ_NOT_NEARLY_FULL otherwise. On failure returns
DZQ_FAIL_NO_Q if q was a NULL pointer or DZQ_FAIL_EMPTY
if the queue was actually empty. Note that failure codes
are less than zero, success codes greater than or equal
to zero. It\'s not a bad idea to use
queue_empty before calling queue_peek_ to verify that there is data
to get.
