DZCOMM

Unix-specific information.

See readme.txt for a more general overview.



====================================
============ Unix notes ============
====================================

   Status: A first version has been written. It does not yet handle IRQ
   and port address setting, but these are not really pertinant on a generic
   unix architecture. I'm not sure if the break code works yet.



===========================================
============ Required software ============
===========================================

   Since you are using a Real Operating System, the chances are that you 
   already have all the necessary development tools.



============================================
============ Installing Dzcomm =============
============================================

   Fix up:
      $ chmod +x fixunix.sh
      $ ./fixunix.sh

   Configure [use the -help option to see the options]:
      $ ./configure

   Build:
      $ make

   Install: (note that you probably need to be root here)
      # make install
