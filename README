It seemed like quite a few things needed patching/converting/fixing to get 
scantool to compile cleanly on ubuntu so I thought I'd share my copy of
the source with patched dzcomm library and makefile which enabled me to
compile on Ubuntu (10.10 - netbook edition).

To compile you'll still need to use apt to retrieve a bunch of dependent
libraries but you shouldn't have to manually download and compile anything
other than what is here.
